Notes for packagers:

The package is intended to be installed via the Debian packaging system,
which takes care of installing configuration files, log rotation scripts,
etc. To create a Debian package, install the debhelper tools and execute:

    debuild

in this folder. The script: "script/build-source-tarball.sh" creates a
aws-s3fs_(version).orig.tar.xz tarball with the current source which is
required by the debhelper tools.

The autoconf tool should install the files properly, too, using the standard
./configure; make; make install procedure. If you elect to attempt the vanilla
autoconf installation procedure, you'll first need to run:

    ./autoreconf -i

in the root directory of the package in order to create the necessary files
for building and installing with autoconf.

I have no idea how to package the code for other systems, but feel free to
provide patches that will enable other build systems.

The code is lint clean, with intentional overrides included in the source code
where appropriate. Most of these overrides are related to intentional NULL
pointers.

The code is documented with Doxygen comments. The documentation is built in
doc/doxygen when "make" is run and the Makefile has been configured with the
option:

    ./configure --enable-doc

To generate the documentation, make sure that Doxygen and GraphViz are
installed.

I am aware of the s3fs code from Randy Rizun <rrizun@gmail.com>. However, this
code relies on OpenSSL whose license conflicts with the GPL, and it seems to
have problems supporting buckets that are not stored on the Standard US server.
My impression of the quality of the code made me decide to implement aws-s3fs
from scratch rather than attempting to patch Randy Rizun's code.

The build requirements include the OpenSSL executable; this is not strictly
a requirement for the build itself, but the cryptographic tests use OpenSSL
for verification during "make check". There is no OpenSSL code in the aws-s3fs
source or executable, however, as the GPL requirements would violate the
OpenSSL license. To skip OpenSSL tests, configure the build with the following
option:

    ./configure --disable-openssltest
