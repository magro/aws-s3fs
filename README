Notes for packagers:

The package is intended to be installed via the Debian packaging system,
which takes care of installing configuration files, log rotation scripts,
etc. To create a Debian package, install the debhelper tools and execute:

  debuild

in this folder. The script: "script/build-source-tarball.sh" creates the
aws-s3fs_(version).orig.tar.xz tarball with the current source which is
required by the debhelper tools.

The autoconf files themselves may be able to install some of the files, too,
using the standard ./configure; make; make install procedure. However, this is
untested as the debhelper scripts are more than adequate for the task.

The code is lint clean, with intentional overrides included in the source code
where appropriate.
