* Add an authorization against S3 to the CONNECT request in the filecache.

* Use petgwuid() instead of "manually" parsing the passwd and group files.

* Add BitTorrents support.

* Add a status option indicating cache state and other things.

* Add reduced-reduncancy storage option.

* Add storage encryption option.

* Recheck thread safety. Some files exit with exit(), but beyond that:
  - logging.c OK
  - statcache.c OK
  - common.c OK
  - config.c OK
  - configfile.c OK
  - decodecmdline.c OK
  - logger.c OK
  - statcache.c OK

* Multiple mounts of the same bucket MUST share at least the file cache.
  - For now, use a lock file to prevent processes from mounting the same bucket.
  - Later, make threads?
