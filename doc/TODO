* Add BitTorrents support.

* Add a status option indicating cache state and other things.

* Add reduced-reduncancy storage option.

* Add storage encryption option.

* Add file caching system.

* Recheck thread safety. Some files exit with exit(), but beyond that:
  - logging.c OK
  - statcache.c OK
  - common.c OK
  - config.c OK
  - configfile.c OK
  - daemon.c not thread safe.
  - decodecmdline.c OK
  - logger.c OK
  - statcache.c OK

* Make daemon.c thread-safe.
  - In particular, the signal handler won't know which thread state to address.

* Multiple mounts of the same bucket MUST share the cache.
  - For now, use a lock file to prevent processes from mounting the same bucket.
  - Later, make threads.
