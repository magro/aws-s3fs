Notes for packagers:

The package is intended to be installed via the Debian packaging system,
which takes care of installing configuration files, log rotation scripts,
etc. To create a Debian package, install the debhelper tools and execute:

  debuild

in this folder. The script: "script/build-source-tarball.sh" creates the
aws-s3fs_(version).orig.tar.xz tarball with the current source which is
required by the debhelper tools.

The autoconf tool should install the files properly, too, using the standard
./configure; make; make install procedure. However, this is mostly untested
as the debhelper scripts are more than adequate for the task. If you elect to
attempt the vanilla autoconf installation procedure, you'll need to run:

   autoreconf --install

in the root directory of the package in order to create the necessary files
for building and installing with autoconf.

I have no idea how to package the code for other systems, but feel free to
provide patches that will enable other build systems.

The code is lint clean, with intentional overrides included in the source code
where appropriate. Most of these overrides are related to intentional NULL
pointers. This is old school C the way I learned it in the late 1980'es. :)
The code is documented with Doxygen comments. Type "make doxygen" to generate
the Doxygen documentation, which is created in doc/doxygen. Doxygen uses
GraphViz to produce call graphs, so you may want to install that, too.

A special thanks goes to Timothy Kay <http://timkay.com/> for providing the
aws script, which serves as the backbone for aws-s3fs.
